           <p id = "how">I was sitting in a matatu (public transport vehicle) when i started scrolling my WhatsApp page. I was a member of a group that had been set up to condole one of our workmate who had recently lost a loved one. On that particular day, it was the day of the funeral. Pictures were being shared right, left and center of the funeral service by the group's administrator. One of the group member asked for the deceased eulogy so that we can know a little bit more about the deceased. <br> Presently after, the administrator promptly uploaded the eulogy in the group for members to read. I could not wait to read the document. As I tried to click the document so that it can open ... it gave one of the dreaded message that we normally encounter on our mobile gadgets ... 'You may not have a proper app for viewing this content'. I was like, how now? Apparently, the document was in a PDF format and suffice to say, I did not have a PDF viewer app in my mobile phone. I only had Word app on my phone and as you know, only opens documents configured in the Word format. I was torn between asking the administrator for the Word version or just let it pass. At last, I let it pass. <br> And this scenario got me thinking, how many people like me have an internet enabled phone but could not access the information because it was processed in a format that could not configure in their phones? How can we solve this? <br>That is when this idea of creating or processing information in a way that anyone can access it provided they have an internet enabled phone, and a browser of course. I had taken some courses online in regards to digital marketing, search engine optimization (SEO), computer programming/coding, on top of my Associate degree in Public Relations that I acquired at Kenyatta University, Nairobi, Kenya. (For more elaborations on my credentials, click <a href="about.html">HERE</a>, under the banner, 'Get to know the founder'.) And I thought, why don't I bring this skills together and try to overcome this challenge.<br>So that is how Levkin LIVE idea came about. <br>
        Why the name 'Levkin'? Well, I was looking for a unique name that will differentiate the entity from others. I chose my first name Kelvin, but the name is common, not that it is not unique, but wanted something different, my own creation, and that's why I transpositioned the characters in my first name to come up with Levkin. So, yes, Levkin is Kelvin but the characters have been interchanged. <br>So, ladies and gentlemen, that is my short story about this entity on how it came to being. <br>Thank you.</p>
